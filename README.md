This is a Data Analysis challenge I solved for a Travel Company that rents out holdiay apartments through Directly owned and Third party channels.

The task was to analyse Week 34's performance using the available data, and focus on the drivers of performance and recommendations. 

Since the data contained pre-aggregated tables in xls., the analysis was done in Excel and Power BI.
